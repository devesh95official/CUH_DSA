# C++ STL Study Materials

This repository contains example programs and study materials for C++ Standard Template Library (STL).

## Directory Structure

- `01_Containers/` - Examples of STL containers (vector, list, map, set, etc.)
- `02_Algorithms/` - Examples of STL algorithms (sort, find, transform, etc.)
- `03_Iterators/` - Examples of STL iterators and their usage

## Getting Started

Each directory contains example programs demonstrating different aspects of STL. You can compile and run these programs using any C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.

### Compilation Example (using g++)

```bash
g++ program.cpp -o program
./program
```
